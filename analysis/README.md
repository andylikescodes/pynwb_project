# Analysis

### Behavioral Analysis
Run main.py will call a function run behavioral analysis (plotting graphs) iterating
all files in the data folder.

### Single Neuron Analysis
Run main.py will run some sample code for plotting the raster plot and PSTH for single neurons. It might take a while to
since it is iterating the entire nwb data set.
